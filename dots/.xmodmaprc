! Set Caps_Lock to Escape
! I tried to clear Lock and add Control_L everywhere in this

! on the .xinitrc file.
keycode 66 = Control_L

! Space to Super_L (mod4)
remove mod4 = Super_L
keycode 65 = Super_L
keycode 250 = space

! Tab to Mode_switch
keycode 23 = Mode_switch
keycode 252 = Tab
add mod3 = Mode_switch
