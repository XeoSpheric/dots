# [Dots](../README.md) – Dots

## Files
- **.config** – Configuration directories for most things that need to be
  configured.
- **.zshrc** – Entry point for ZSH configuration. The rest of the
  configuration is in **.config/zsh**.

## Zsh

For organization and copying after ChrisTitusTech, the **.zshrc** is small and sources other files to complete the job. I import PowerLevel10K and zsh-autosuggest from prebuilt packages then also supply an aliasrc file containing my shortcuts.
